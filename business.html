          <h1 class="sectionTitle-white container">Technology is born from a problem.</h1>
          <p class="sectionDescription-white container">Think about big and small businesses before the World Wide Web. Part of those businesses relied on storing and accessing data on local data servers or computers that relied on local electricity. If disaster struck, those businesses may have suffered trying to recover their recoverable or irrecoverable data from those servers or computers. But there was a better option for storing data.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="conceptsSubsection" class="sectionContent-sub">
          <h1 class="sectionTitle-black container">Got ideas? No problem.</h1>
          <p class="sectionDescription-black container">Knowing the problem developers from technology organizations got down to work, using the concepts of something known as "cloud" computing to create software solutions for businesses. One of those "cloud" computing concepts they used is one of the first, one that dates back to the 1960s: an "intergalactic computer network" which was envisioned for everyone on the globe to be interconnected to (through a computer), allowing users to access and store programs and data on the network from anywhere (this intergalactic network was later known as the Internet). This concept later defined the "cloud" computing buzzword.</p>

          <h1 class="sectionTitle-white container">Cloud solutions for next-gen business.</h1>
          <p class="sectionDescription-white container">Developers finally deployed their software solutions to businesses needing more reliable data storage. The result: these solutions are successfully transforming today's businesses around the world.</p>
          <p class="sectionDescription-white container">Here are some of those cloud solutions:</p>

          <h1 class="sectionTitle-white container">Pros</h1>
          <p class="subtitleText container">Accessibility</p>
          <p class="sectionDescription-white container">Ever thought of being able to plug in a USB drive into your phone to increase productivity time? Use cloud computing instead. Because the cloud is Internet-based, your business's digital files (documents, photos, videos, webpages, etc.) stored in the cloud can be accessed on an Internet-connected device anywhere with an Internet connection. This means you can access projects and records on any phone, laptop, tablet, or wearable from any Internet-enabled vehicle, Web-accessible place, or cellular network. With the accessibility of the cloud, you can get your productivity time back.</p>
          <p class="subtitleText container">Collaboration</p>
          <p class="sectionDescription-white container">It’s hard to physically collaborate with others scattered around a large urban region. Cloud computing aims to solve this problem. Because the cloud can be interacted with through multiple-way Internet communication, some web apps such as Web-based word processors allow multiple users to collaborate on a document or in a virtual conference together in real time over the Internet without moving away from their current location. This saves collaborators time and money. Add that (cloud collaboration) to accessibility.</p>
          <p class="subtitleText container">Disaster Recovery</p>
          <p class="sectionDescription-white container">It’s difficult to recover data from destroyed or unresponsive computer storage devices, but it doesn’t have to be this way. With the business cloud, digital files can be saved and secured on the cloud–a remote location from disasters. Once disaster dissolves, businesses can still access and store their digital files in the cloud. Cloud computing can save businesses.</p>
          <p class="subtitleText container">Scalability</p>
          <p class="sectionDescription-white container">Remember those times when your business had to pay for unnecessary features and options when purchasing computer storage devices? With the business cloud, it doesn’t have to be this way. If your business grows or shrinks, your business’s cloud storage follows (of course, your business may need to contact the cloud service provider to scale the cloud storage). As a result, your business can be more financially strong.</p>

          <h1 class="sectionTitle-white container">Cons</h1>
          <p class="subtitleText container">Security</p>
          <p class="sectionDescription-white container">Cloud computing has come a long way when it comes to security, but the Internet can never be completely secure. Because the cloud is Internet-based, its services such as web apps may be rendered unusable if those services’ data servers are hacked or infected with malware. Other data stored in the cloud may also be exposed to viruses.</p>
          <p class="subtitleText container">Internet Connection, Speed, and User Capacity</p>
          <p class="sectionDescription-white container">Although cloud computing helps to make productivity easier, it relies heavily on the Internet; this means that users have little control on their cloud services. Users will need an Internet connection to access and store data on the cloud whether there is a connection or not. Users may also need good Internet speed to be able to accomplish heavy tasks efficiently. Other users on the Internet may also access the same cloud service; if a cloud service has too many users, the service will be rendered unusable until the number of users decrease below the user cap.</p>
