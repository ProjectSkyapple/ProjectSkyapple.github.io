        <h1 class="jumbotronTitle">Pro: Disaster Recovery</h1>
        <p class="jumbotronDescription">We can’t control Mother Nature. If you save your files on the cloud, you don’t need to worry about natural disasters wiping out your business’s servers or computer storage devices. Your files are saved at a remote location. If a disaster strikes and wipes out your devices, you can easily download your unaffected files that you saved in the cloud to your new devices.</p>

        <h1 class="jumbotronTitle">Pro: Accessibility</h1>
        <p class="jumbotronDescription">Going on a business trip? Taking the bus or train to work or home? Forgot to bring your laptop? Need to make some changes to a document? Good news: since the cloud is internet-based, you can work on any file saved in the cloud anywhere with an internet connection on any internet-enabled device (laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.). This is especially useful for businesses, as time management in a business is important.</p>

        <h1 class="jumbotronTitle">Pro: Collaboration</h1>
        <p class="jumbotronDescription">With cloud computing, employees of your business can increase their desire for collaboration. Employees can collaborate and work concurrently on one same file and sync their work to the cloud, updating the file in real time, increasing business efficiency.</p>

        <h1 class="jumbotronTitle">Con: Privacy</h1>
        <p class="jumbotronDescription">If your business decides to invest in cloud computing services, it should take into consideration the security of its preferred cloud service providers and their services. When your business saves its sensitive data onto the cloud it saves that data onto the cloud service provider’s data centers, and that data could possibly be vulnerable to cloud service providers you didn’t know were untrusted.</p>

      <div class="cons jumbotron">
        <h1 class="jumbotronTitle">Con: Cyberattacks</h1>
        <p class="jumbotronDescription">Since storing files in the cloud means storing files on the internet, those files are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Because the internet is not completely secure, stealth of data in the cloud is possible.</p>

      <div class="cons jumbotron">
        <h1 class="jumbotronTitle">Con: Internet Connectivity</h1>
        <p class="jumbotronDescription">Because cloud computing is internet-based, a business that depends on cloud services may not operate or will operate less efficiently when the business’s internet service provider or cloud service provider loses connectivity. When the business loses internet connectivity it cannot access, add, or modify its data uploaded to the cloud.</p>
